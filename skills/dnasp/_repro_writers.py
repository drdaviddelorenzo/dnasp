"""Writers for the reproducibility/ folder of a dnasp run.

Written for the standalone dnasp package; dnasp.py loads this file by its path
(see _load_repro_writers), so it needs no package installed and cannot be
shadowed by another module of a similar name.

Every file is written as UTF-8 with LF line endings on all platforms, so the
bundle, and therefore its checksums, are byte-identical wherever a run happens.
